As of right now below are the controls:

Tank 1 controls:
a = move gun up
d = move gun down
w = increase gun power
s = decrease gun power
LEFT shift = shoot

Tank 2 controls:
l = move gun up
j = move gun down
i = increase gun power
k = decrease gun power
RIGHT shift = shoot


Still needs a lot of game logic and tank gravity/movement
The command to compile this can be found in the "compile.sh" script
